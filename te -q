Help on function eventplot in module matplotlib.pyplot:

eevveennttpplloott(positions, orientation='horizontal', lineoffsets=1, linelengths=1, linewidths=None, colors=None, linestyles='solid', *, data=None, **kwargs)
    Plot identical parallel lines at the given positions.
    
    *positions* should be a 1D or 2D array-like object, with each row
    corresponding to a row or column of lines.
    
    This type of plot is commonly used in neuroscience for representing
    neural events, where it is usually called a spike raster, dot raster,
    or raster plot.
    
    However, it is useful in any situation where you wish to show the
    timing or position of multiple sets of discrete events, such as the
    arrival times of people to a business on each day of the month or the
    date of hurricanes each year of the last century.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    positions : 1D or 2D array-like object
        Each value is an event. If *positions* is a 2D array-like, each
        row corresponds to a row or a column of lines (depending on the
        *orientation* parameter).
    
    orientation : {'horizontal', 'vertical'}, optional
        Controls the direction of the event collections:
    
            - 'horizontal' : the lines are arranged horizontally in rows,
              and are vertical.
            - 'vertical' : the lines are arranged vertically in columns,
              and are horizontal.
    
    lineoffsets : scalar or sequence of scalars, optional, default: 1
        The offset of the center of the lines from the origin, in the
        direction orthogonal to *orientation*.
    
    linelengths : scalar or sequence of scalars, optional, default: 1
        The total height of the lines (i.e. the lines stretches from
        ``lineoffset - linelength/2`` to ``lineoffset + linelength/2``).
    
    linewidths : scalar, scalar sequence or None, optional, default: None
        The line width(s) of the event lines, in points. If it is None,
        defaults to its rcParams setting.
    
    colors : color, sequence of colors or None, optional, default: None
        The color(s) of the event lines. If it is None, defaults to its
        rcParams setting.
    
    linestyles : str or tuple or a sequence of such values, optional
        Default is 'solid'. Valid strings are ['solid', 'dashed',
        'dashdot', 'dotted', '-', '--', '-.', ':']. Dash tuples
        should be of the form::
    
            (offset, onoffseq),
    
        where *onoffseq* is an even length tuple of on and off ink
        in points.
    
    **kwargs : optional
        Other keyword arguments are line collection properties.  See
        :class:`~matplotlib.collections.LineCollection` for a list of
        the valid properties.
    
    Returns
    -------
    
    list : A list of :class:`~.collections.EventCollection` objects.
        Contains the :class:`~.collections.EventCollection` that
        were added.
    
    Notes
    -----
    
    For *linelengths*, *linewidths*, *colors*, and *linestyles*, if only
    a single value is given, that value is applied to all lines.  If an
    array-like is given, it must have the same length as *positions*, and
    each value will be applied to the corresponding row of the array.
    
    Examples
    --------
    
    .. plot:: gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/eventplot_demo.py
    
    .. note::
        In addition to the above described arguments, this function can take a
        **data** keyword argument. If such a **data** argument is given, the
        following arguments are replaced by **data[<arg>]**:
    
        * All arguments with the following names: 'colors', 'linelengths', 'lineoffsets', 'linestyles', 'linewidths', 'positions'.
    
        Objects passed as **data** must support item access (``data[<arg>]``) and
        membership test (``<arg> in data``).
